Compiling Instructions
======================

Requirements
------------
- Git
- CMake
- Compiler:
    - Linux: GCC
    - Windows: MSYS with MinGW (GCC for Windows) OR Microsoft Visual Studio

Visual Studio
-------------
1. In the SMPSPlay\ folder, execute "git submodule update --init" to download the "libvgm" submodule.
2. In the SMPSPlay\libs\ folder, execute the "build_libs_VC*.bat" file that matches your version of Visual Studio.
   Notes:
    - In order to build with VC 2005 or VC 2008, you need to edit the GENERATOR line in build_libs_VC2010-*.bat.
    - In order to build with VC 2012 and higher, you need to edit the GENERATOR and TOOLSET lines in build_libs_VC2017-*.bat.
    - You may run both, the Win32 and Win64 .bat files, in order to compile 32 and 64 bit versions of the libraries.
   The .bat files will build the required libraries and install their .h and .lib files into the "install" folder.
3. [way 1] Open SMPSPlay.dsw (VC6) / SMPSPlay.sln (VC 2010 and higher) and compile.
3. [way 2] Open a command prompt and go to the SMPSPlay\ folder.
   Execute:
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -D libvgm_DIR="%CD%/../libs/install/lib/cmake/libvgm" ..
        cmake --build .

GCC/MinGW
---------
1. In the SMPSPlay/ folder, execute "git submodule update --init" to download the "libvgm" submodule.
2. Go to the SMPSPlay/libs/ folder and run build_libs_GCC.sh.
   The script will build the required libraries and install their .h and .lib files into the "install" folder.
3. In the SMPSPlay/ folder, execute the following commands:
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -D libvgm_DIR="$PWD/../libs/install/lib/cmake/libvgm" ..
        make
